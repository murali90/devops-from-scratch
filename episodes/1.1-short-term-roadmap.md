# Path to setting up a simple website

## Our current goal

For these upcoming videos, let's set a goal. **Our goal is to setup a simple website**

To be able to achieve that, we need to be familiar with the following:

1. We need a Linux Virtual Server to host our website
    - Virtualization
    - What and why of Linux
    - Installing a Linux server on virtual machine
2. Access the server so that we can do our thing
    - Shell
    - SSH
3. We need to be able to navigate the server
    - `cd`, `ls`, `pushd`, `popd` etc
    - Filesystem hierarchy of Linux
4. We need to be able to read, create and modify files
    - `mkdir`, `cat`, `echo` etc
    - Text editors - `vim`
5. Create a user to run our webserver as
    - User management in Linux
    - Permissions
6. Installing our webserver
    - Webservers
    - Package management
7. Starting our webserver
    - Managing services using `systemctl`
8. Checking if our website works
    - Process management (`ps`, `kill` etc)
    - Working with `curl`, `netstat`, `netcat`
9. Configuring our webserver for our liking
    - VirtualHost, Host header
    - Configuring Nginx
    - Checking log files using `tail`, `less`
    - Finding patterns using `grep`
