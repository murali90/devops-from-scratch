# A simple NodeJS Application

This contains a simple nodejs application. The idea is to get familiar
with deploying nodejs applications in a production kinda environment

This contains an Nginx server, and two nodejs processes, all running on the
same server. There are two nodejs apps to imitate a real world load balancing
scenario. I am keeping them all in the same server because running too many
virtual machines isn't the most optimal way to handle it locally
